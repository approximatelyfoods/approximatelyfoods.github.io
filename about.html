        <p>There is a dichotomous debate in today’s vision for the future of food. Advocates for organic and free-range food products on one-side,
        industrial rganically grown plants and free-range animals on one side, industrial processed and biotech-engineered foods on the other. What are real foods?</p>
        <p>Approximately food explores the in-betweens of real and fake, natural and artificial, accepted and discarded. It rethinks why we eat what we eat and imagine what will be in our plates in the future.</p>
          <p> </h4>Technology</h4></br>Technology enables progress, but it doesn’t mean everything is progress. With each breakthrough in some fundamental technology,
             humans have undertaken an expansionary exploration using the innovation to create new possible foods. For example, fire - cooked food, agriculture - domestication of plants, industrial production line - processed food.</p>
          <p> Often times, however, we use technology for technology’s sake without the proper care and thoughtfulness as to its consequences and to its necessities. Heavily-salted dried meats was an important technique and tradition
               of food preservation, but is it necessary to apply that technique to other applications, especially given the context of today?</p>
